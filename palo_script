# This lovely mess was made by an impromptu Palo scrub the 2023-2024    # 
# Metro CCDC team. Just call me Eggy. Anyway, most of these are pretty  #
# self explanitory as each block of script is headed by a title that    #
# esentially describes what each chunk does. A few are a bit funny      #
# like the 'Inject Specific' rules I put on the way bottom under the    # 
# content breaker of the same name. Just know you don't have to use     #
# all of this and some things may be worth a second glance as, as       #
# previously stated, I am a novice. Also, this script was created with  #
# copy/pasting in mind so no, you cannot just make this executable and  #
# run it. You have to pull out chunks if you want need certain things.  #
# Finally, let it be noted that MOST of these run in configure mode of  #
# Palo but not all. Which ones don't you may ask? I dunno. I forgot to  #
# check. A couple are listed by the rest you're just gonna have to      #
# figure out on your own. Anyway, good luck future Palo predecessor of  #
# mine. Here's hoping you preceed me in all the best ways.              #
